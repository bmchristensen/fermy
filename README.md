  This application is in development by Brian Christensen and Ben Nesbit.

  It is a "Brewer's Log" application, that will allow the user to log and access
  information about their brewing process including: type of ingredients used,
  amount of ingredients used, weather conditions, and make any additional notes
  about the brewing process. There will also be a section for each brew that the
  user can fill out after the brew is complete to make any notes.

To get this application up and running, one must first install ruby:

  Linux (Recommended):
  Here is the documentation for installing ruby and getting it up and running
  https://rubyinstaller.org/
  In the Linux command line, type:
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full

  Mac OS (Recommended that you use Linux, but):
  Here is a helpful site for installing ruby not on Linux
  https://rubyinstaller.org/

  Windows (Seriously, just use Linux):
  If you don't want to dual-boot or switch over to Linux, you easily run a
  Linux subsystem on your computer, such as Ubuntu:
  https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-linux-subsystem-for-windows10/

  I guess if you really, REALLY don't want to use Linux or a Linux subsystem,
  you can follow the instructions here:
  https://rubyinstaller.org/

Once ruby is installed, run the application by typing:

  ruby THE_FINAL_PROJECT_NAME_WHICH_WILL_JUST_BE_FERMY
